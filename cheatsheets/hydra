#hydra does not have a native default wordlist, using the Rockyou list is suggested

#example brute force crack on ftp server
hydra -t 1 -l admin -P [path to password.lst] -vV [IPaddress] ftp
--> -t # = preform # tasks
--> -l NAME = try to log in with NAME
--> -P [filepath] = Try password
--> -vV = verbose mode, showing the login+pass for each attempt

#check for joe accounts by adding modifier -e s

#to write found login+pass combinations to fiel, add modifier -0 [fileanme]
#

#when testing RDP, make sure that the domain(even if its the hostname) is appended to the IP, otherwise it wont work

#HTTP form bruteforce:
hydra -l user -p pass ip http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid password"
